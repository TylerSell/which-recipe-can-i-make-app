# What Recipe Can I Make?

I came up with the idea for this app when I was trying to figure out what to cook one night.  I had a couple of recipes but wasn't sure if I could make them or not.  I looked through the ingredients and checked my pantry for the ingredients finally finding one of the 4 recipes I chose that I could actually make from my pantry without having to go to the store.

That gave me an idea. Let people:
- Store the recipes that they like to make
- Store the contents of their pantry
- Check a recipe to see if all ingredients are in the pantry.

That is what I did and so far it works flawlessly.

Hope you enjoy.
